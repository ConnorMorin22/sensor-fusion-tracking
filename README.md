# Sensor Fusion & Object Tracking üéØ

This project implements a **multi-sensor fusion and object tracking system** using **camera and LiDAR data**.  
It demonstrates how to integrate multiple perception modalities and apply **Kalman Filters** for motion estimation, prediction, and tracking in robotics and autonomous driving contexts.

## üß† Overview

- **Goal:** Fuse data from LiDAR and camera sensors to track dynamic objects in real-time.  
- **Tech stack:** C++, Python, ROS, Eigen, OpenCV.  
- **Core concepts:** Sensor calibration, coordinate transformations, object detection, Kalman Filters.
